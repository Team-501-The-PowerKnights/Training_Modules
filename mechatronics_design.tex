\chapter{Choosing Motors and Gear Ratios}

 {\slshape \scshape ``Power is worthless, if improperly wielded."}
 
For any system powered by motors we may have a number of concerns.
 \index{cycle}
 \index{sprint}
\begin{asparaenum}[a)]
	\item How fast we can get from one point to another: \textit{cycle} or \textit{sprint} time.
	\item How much electrical energy or current is consumed during the maneuver.
	\item Maximizing how much force can be pushed in a worst-case scenario.
	\item Achieving a target velocity in a given time.
	\item Achieving all of these goals, for various different targets (e.g. different cycle distances).
\end{asparaenum}

This chapter covers how we can use some calculations to design a system with the right amount of motors and an appropriate gear ratio to achieve your targets.

\section{What Do Gears Really Do?}

If we have a motor with a pinion of $N_m$ teeth, mating with a driven gear of $N_d$ teeth, we would achieve a gear ratio of

\begin{align}
  G = \frac{N_d}{N_m} = \frac{\omega_m}{\omega_d} = \frac{T_d}{T_m}
\end{align}

This also works with belts or sprockets and chain (though you may need to keep an eye on the direction of rotation, as gears can reverse the direction of rotation).


\begin{figure}[H] \centering
\begin{tikzpicture}[x=3.5in,y=2.0in]
  %\fill[lightgray] (1.0,0)--(0,1.0)--(0,0)--cycle;
  \draw[black] (-0.1,0)--(1.2,0) node[pos=0.5,below]{Gearbox speed $\omega$, RPM};
  \draw[black] (0,-0.1)--(0,1.2) node[pos=0.5,above,rotate=90,teal]{Torque $T$, N-m};

  \draw[teal, ultra thick] (1.0,0)--(0,0.3) node[pos=0.6, right, black]{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1:1 (No) Reduction};
  \draw[teal, ultra thick] (0.3,0)--(0,1.0) node[pos=0.7, right, black]{\ 3:1 Reduction};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{A 3:1 gear reduction shifts the effective motor curve of a gearbox.}
\end{figure}

The 3:1 ratio reduces maximum speed, but increases the maximum torque. It also changes the RPM at which maximum power and efficiency occur. A gearbox that has too much gear-down:
\begin{asparaitem}
	\item Quickly gets up to its maximum speed and remains there throughout the majority of its action.
	\item Operates beyond the speed necessary for peak efficiency of the motor.
	\item Operates for too long, wasting electrical power.
\end{asparaitem}

Whereas a gearbox that is not geared down enough:
\begin{asparaitem}
	\item Operates below the speed necessary for peak power or efficiency of the motor.
	\item Pulls excessive current, wasting electrical power.
	\item May not even move at all in the first place, lacking the strength to overcome load placed on it.
\end{asparaitem}

But how do we know that we've geared appropriately? We could definitely test all the different ratios, gather all the operating data, and then draw a conclusion... or we could do some preemptive math. Don't worry- you don't even need to get your hands too dirty. All of the rough stuff has been done already- you just need to know how to use the design applications to get the answer you want.

But knowing roughly what's going on is important. There's an old joke in engineering,

 {\slshape \scshape ``All data is wrong. But this data, having gone through an incredibly sophisticated computer, is somehow ennobled and none dare question it."}
 
 Which roughly translates to: ``You can't just mash buttons and trust the results".

\section{Developing a Generalized Mechanism Model}

\subsection{The Simple Flywheel Case}

Let's examine a simple case of a motor accelerating a flywheel. This is also (essentially) the same as any system with no friction or gravity-fighting (like an ideal drivetrain).
	
	\begin{figure}[H] \centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[x=1.0in,y=1.0in]
		\draw[ultra thick] (0,0) circle (0.1);
		\fill[black] (0,0.1)--(0,0)--(0.1,0) arc[start angle=0, end angle=90, radius=0.1]--cycle;
		\fill[black] (0,-0.1)--(0,0)--(-0.1,0) arc[start angle=180, end angle=270, radius=0.1]--cycle;
		\draw[ultra thick, black] (0,0) circle (0.5);
		
		%\draw[ultra thick, red, ->] (0,0.6) arc[start angle=90, end angle=180, radius=0.6] node[pos=0.7,left]{$M_{resist}$};
		\draw[ultra thick, OliveGreen, ->] (0,0.6) arc[start angle=90, end angle=0, radius=0.6] node[pos=0.7,right]{$T_{gbx}$};
		
		\draw[ultra thick, blue, ->] (0,0.2) arc[start angle=90, end angle=-30, radius=0.2] node[pos=0.7,right]{$I \alpha$};
	\end{tikzpicture}	
	\caption{Free-body diagram of the flywheel}
	\end{figure}	
	
	We can apply conservation of angular momentum to the flywheel.
	\begin{align}
		%\sum M &= I \alpha + \cancelto{0 \ \mbox{(no mass transfer)}}{\sum \dot{m}(...)} \\
		T_{gbx} &= I \ \alpha_{wheel}
	\end{align}
	
	This tells us about the rate of acceleration $\alpha$, but what about the velocity $\omega$? 
		
	\begin{align}
		\alpha_{wheel} &= \frac{d \omega_{wheel}}{dt} \\
		\omega_{motor} &= G \omega_{wheel} \\
		G T_{stall} \frac{\omega_{free} - \omega}{\omega_{free}} &= \frac{I}{G} \frac{d \omega}{dt}
	\end{align}
	
		This is a "differential equation" ($\frac{d \omega}{dt}$ and $\omega$ appear in the same equation). These are tricky to solve. \textit{There be dragons ahead. If you don't care to know all the intricate mathy details, skim ahead. I don't blame you.}
		
	\subsection{The Full-Blown Calculus Approach}
	
	We can solve differential equations with calculus!	
	\begin{align}
		\mbox{let }& &B  &= \frac{G^2 T_{stall}}{I} \\
		\mbox{Substitute: }& & B\ \frac{\omega_{free} - \omega}{\omega_{free}} &= \frac{d \omega}{d t} \\
		\mbox{Separate and integrate: }& & \int B\ dt &= \int \frac{\omega_{free}}{\omega_{free} - \omega} d \omega \\
		\mbox{Compute integral (introduces $C$): }& & B t + C &= -\omega_{free}\ ln[\omega_{free} - \omega] \\
		\mbox{Solve for $\omega$: }& & \omega &= \omega_{free} - C\ e^{-\frac{B t}{\omega{max}}} \\
		\mbox{Solve for C with initial condition }& & \omega(0) &= 0 \rightarrow C = \omega_{free} \\
		& &\omega &= \omega_{free}\ [1 - e^{-\frac{G^2\ T_{stall}\ t}{I\ \omega{max}}}] \\
		& &\omega_{gbx} &= \frac{\omega_{free}}{G}\ [1 - e^{-\frac{G^2\ T_{stall}\ t}{I\ \omega{max}}}]
	\end{align}	
	
	If we plot this algebraic solution with some generalized values, we can start to investigate what it really means.	
	
	\begin{figure}[H] \centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[x=3.0in,y=1.5in]
		%\draw[gray] (0,0)--(3,0) node[pos=0.5,below,black]{Time $t$};
		%\draw[gray] (0,0)--(0,2) node[pos=0.5,above,rotate=90,black]{Ang. Velocity $\omega_{gbx}$};

          axis lines=middle,
          restrict y to domain=-7:12,
          xlabel={Time $t$},
          ylabel={Velocity $\omega_{gbx}$}
          ]
		\addplot[blue,domain=0:5,samples=100]  {1*(1-exp(-1^2*x))} node[pos=0.8,below] {Baseline};
		\addplot[purple,domain=0:5,samples=100]  {1*(1-exp(-1^2/2*x))} node[pos=0.7,below right] {Lower $\frac{T_{stall}}{I}$};
		\addplot[red,domain=0:5,samples=100]  {1/2*(1-exp(-2^2*x))} node[above left] {Higher G};
		\end{axis}
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\caption{Flywheel example solution, with different representative parameters}
	\end{figure}
		
	This assumes that there is no constant load, or friction.
	This behavior is generally true, but not exactly true.
	
	\subsection{A Brute-Force Approach}
	We don't need to solve that differential equation using calculus. Or math. We can use basic arithmetic and computers to simulate it! We can do this with a 'numeric differential equation solver', like Euler's Method:
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{d}{dt} f(t) \approx \frac{\Delta f(t)}{\Delta t}
	\end{equation}\begin{equation}
		f(t_{i+1}) = f(t_{i}) + \frac{d}{dt}[f(t_{i})]\ {\Delta t}
	\end{equation}
	
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{imgs/euler_method.png}
		\caption{Graphical representation of Euler's method.}
	\end{figure}
	
	Another way of putting it... "the next value is the current value, plus the rate of change times the timestep of the simulation". 	We just need to get an expression for the $\frac{d}{dt}f(t)$ we are interested in, and write some code that will repeat this process with a small enough $\Delta t$. This process is sometimes called 'discretization' since we are taking a continuous field of time $t$ and separating it into little $\Delta t$ chunks.	
		
	Let's go back to our flywheel example, and add resistance $M_{resist}$ to it. This $M_{resist}$ can be anything- it can represent friction, air resistance, a spring, you name it! The numeric simulation approach makes this trivial.
	
	\begin{figure}[H] \centering
	\begin{tikzpicture}[x=1.0in,y=1.0in]
		\draw[ultra thick] (0,0) circle (0.1);
		\fill[black] (0,0.1)--(0,0)--(0.1,0) arc[start angle=0, end angle=90, radius=0.1]--cycle;
		\fill[black] (0,-0.1)--(0,0)--(-0.1,0) arc[start angle=180, end angle=270, radius=0.1]--cycle;
		\draw[ultra thick, black] (0,0) circle (0.5);
		
		\draw[ultra thick, red, ->] (-0.1,0.6) arc[start angle=99.6, end angle=180, radius=0.608] node[pos=0.7,left]{$M_{resist}$};
		\draw[ultra thick, OliveGreen, ->] (0.1,0.6) arc[start angle=80.4, end angle=0, radius=0.608] node[pos=0.7,right]{$T_{gbx}$};
		
		\draw[ultra thick, blue, ->] (0,0.2) arc[start angle=90, end angle=-30, radius=0.2] node[pos=0.7,right]{$I \alpha$};
	\end{tikzpicture}	
	\caption{Free-body diagram for the flywheel, with additional resistance $M_{resist}$.}
	\end{figure}
	
	We can go through and repeat the same analysis as before.
	\begin{align}
		%\sum M &= I \alpha + \cancelto{0 \ \mbox{(no mass transfer)}}{\sum \dot{m}(...)}  \\
		T_{gbx} - M_{resist} &= I \alpha_{wheel} \\
		\alpha_{wheel} &= \frac{d}{dt} \omega_{wheel} \\
	\end{align}
	
We can solve to yield the equations we need to perform Euler's method:	
	
	\begin{align}
		\frac{d}{dt} \omega_{wheel} &= \frac{T_{gbx} - M_{resist}}{I} \\
		\frac{d}{dt} \theta_{wheel} &= \omega_{wheel}
	\end{align}

\section{Using the Simulations: Analysis/Optimization Examples}

Let's consider an example drivetrain, with 4 NEOs, 8" diameter wheels, weighing about 143 pounds, meeting 30 N of resistive force. We want to go 10 meters. We have two gear ratio options to consider: a 10:1 gearbox, and a 7:1 gearbox. Which should we pick?

Before you look at the plots, go to the simulator and plug in those values, see if you can come up with an answer of which gets to the destination faster.

\clearpage
	
	\begin{figure}[H] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/thsae_1.png}
	\caption{Baseline simulation, G = 10, t = 2.03 s}
	\end{figure}
	
	\begin{figure}[H] \centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{imgs/thsae_2.png}
	\caption{Alternative simulation, G = 7, t = 1.88 s}
	\end{figure}
	
	It looks like the ratio of 7 will get to our destination faster!
	
	However, maybe this isn't our only concern. Drivetrains are complex mechanisms with many objectives (as we'll discuss later). This simulator uses a similar approach as discussed above to compute energy consumption, and it turns out that the G = 10 case has lower current consumption (almost half!) in this maneuver. It has more initial pushing power. It also gets to positions less than 3 meters away faster. There are a lot of trade-offs!
	
	The calculator won't give you the right answer right off the bat, but it does free you from thinking about the numbers and math too much so you can focus on making system-level decisions, which is something that a computer can't quite so easily do.
	
\chapter{Design Principles}

 {\slshape \scshape ``Learn the rules like a pro, so you can break them like an artist." - Pablo Picasso}
 
Design is tough. Before we get in the weeds I want to acknowledge that it isn't for the faint of heart, and it isn't a straightforward linear process. Often when you finish solving one problem, you'll find you've introduced another in the process. Design is iterative. Design is also play. If everything we did just simply worked no better than anything else, we wouldn't need to design things and wouldn't get anything from us, so we should be thankful that it's hard.

There are some general strategies designers have come up with that help while we play within the rules that physics gives us. Like any rules, there are times for them to be broken but you need to know the rule before you can break it. Every design is a compromise.

\section{Load paths}

When we consider structures and systems that we build, we need to think about the forces that go through them, not only at the point of application, but how they propogate through.

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:load_paths}
	Loads can only be transferred, not evaporated.
\end{theorem}

Proof: Consider the links in a chain. When you pull on a chain, the load isn't seen only by the first link. The load is transferred from your hand into the first, then into the second, the third, so on and so forth until eventually it is resolved into the ground, and transferred back to you via your feet. At no point does the load disappear. When you have a force in your system, all the parts in the loop must be built in order to handle the force.

It also follows that because of this, direct load paths tend to be the best course of action. If you're worried about links in a chain failing, remove links and make the chain shorter. Don't use a baseball bat to pull sideways on the chain- pull the chain directly. The straighter and more direct your path, the stronger and stiffer the link will be.

Note I say stiffer. There can be times where you want non-stiffness, like in a suspension! Look at any suspension system and you'll see specifically designed points where the load is very indirect and winding. Springs are a fantastic example of this.

\section{Axial Versus Bending}

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:axial_bending}
	Axial is stronger and stiffer than bending.
\end{theorem}

You've probably heard that triangles are a very strong shape. This is essentially a rudimentary understanding of this principle that axial is stronger than bending. If you're designing structures with long, slender tubes, a good rule of thumb is to make sure that structure is \textit{triangulated}\index{triangulation}.
I'll demonstrate this with two structures with load $F$ acting down on them. Both are constructed from round bar as shown.

\caption{Cantilevered structure}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Trussed versus cantilevered structures.}
\end{figure}

The stress that the cantilevered beam sees varies along the cross-section as shown below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{subfigure}[b]{.4\linewidth}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw[ultra thick, JungleGreen] (-1.5,1)--(0,1)--(0,-1)--(-1.5,-1);
	\foreach \x in {0.9,0.7,...,-0.9}{
		\draw[->, thick, BrickRed] (0,\x) -- (\x, \x);
		}
	\draw[dashed, lightgray] (-1.6,0)--(1.6,0);
	\draw[->, thick] (1.2,0)--(1.2,0.6) node[pos=0.5, right]{$y$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{subfigure}\begin{subfigure}[b]{.5\linewidth}
\large
\begin{align}
	\sigma = \frac{M y}{I} = \frac{M}{S}
\end{align}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Stress (red arrows) in a cantilevered beam (teal).}
\end{figure}

The stress is the highest at the outer portions of the tube, and can be found by the bending moment $M$ induced on the tube, the radius of the tube $y$ and moment of inertia $I$, or the section modulus $S$. You can conduct your own research into these if you want, but an important takeaway from this is that increasing the diameter of the tube will have a huge impact on $I$, so we'd ideally want a very large $I$.

For our example of a round bar,
\begin{align}
%	I = \frac{\pi}{64}(d^4 - (d-t)^4)
%	S = \frac{\pi}{32 d}(d^4 - (d-t)^4)
	I = \frac{\pi}{64}d^4 \\
	S = \frac{\pi}{32}d^3
\end{align}

and in our cantilevered structure, the bending moment at the base is simply $M = F \ l$. This means that we can find the maximum stress as:

\begin{align}
	\sigma_{cantilever} = \frac{F l}{\frac{\pi}{32}d^3}
\end{align}

Which isn't very meaningful until we compare that to the trussed structure.

For the trussed structure, we will assume that all the joints are pinned, so the members of it act as links. This isn't a particularly realistic assumption, but it is in some ways a conservative one. We can then analyze the node where the force $F$ is applied.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{subfigure}[b]{.4\linewidth}
\begin{tikzpicture}
	\fill[black] (0,0) circle (0.1);
	\draw[->, thick] (0, 1) -- (0, 0.2) node [pos=0.5, right]{$F$};
	\draw[->, thick] (-0.2, 0) -- (-1, 0) node[pos=1, left]{$F_1$};
	\draw[->, thick] (-0.7,-0.7) -- (-0.14,-0.14) node[pos=0,left]{$F_2$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{subfigure}\begin{subfigure}[b]{.5\linewidth}
\begin{align}
	\sum F_x &= 0 \ \ \rightarrow & F_2 cos(\theta) - F &= 0 \\
	\sum F_y &= 0 \ \ \rightarrow & F_1 - F_2 sin(\theta) &= 0
\end{align}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{Free-body diagram for node of force application.}
\end{figure}

We can then solve for the forces in the links:

\begin{align}
	F_1 &= F tan(\theta) \\
	F_2 &= F \frac{1}{cos(\theta)}
\end{align}

For simple links like these, the stress is simply the force in the link, divided by the cross-sectional area.

\begin{align}
	\sigma_{truss, 1} &= \frac{F}{\frac{\pi}{4} d^2} \ tan (\theta) = \frac{F}{\frac{\pi}{4} d^2} \frac{sin(\theta)}{cos(\theta)} \\
	\sigma_{truss, 2} &= \frac{F}{\frac{\pi}{4} d^2} \frac{1}{cos(\theta)} & 
\end{align}

This isn't immediately comparable to the cantilever, as it doesn't have $l$ in its expression, and the cantilever example doesn't have $\theta$. But we can consider the example of:

\begin{table}[]
\begin{tabular}{llll}
$F$       & $d$      & $\theta$      & $l$     \\
$100$ lbf & $0.5$ in & $30$ degrees & $10$ in
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{align}
	\sigma_{truss, 1} &= \frac{100 \ \mbox{lbf}}{\frac{\pi}{4} (0.5 \ \mbox{in})^2 } tan(30 \ \mbox{degrees}) &= 295 \ psi\\
	\sigma_{truss, 2} &= \frac{100 \ \mbox{lbf}}{\frac{\pi}{4} (0.5 \ \mbox{in})^2 } \frac{1}{cos(30 \ \mbox{degrees})} &= 588 \ psi \\
	\sigma_{cantilever} &= \frac{100 \ \mbox{lbf} \ 10 \mbox{in}}{\frac{\pi}{32} (0.5 \ \mbox{in})^3} &= 81500 \ psi
\end{align}

Those values are so extremely disparate! OK, we're using really thin rods though. If we used that additional weight we save by not having the truss support to beef up the cantilever rod though, we'd get better though, right? After all, that $d$ term is cubed in the cantilever equation!

\begin{align}
	\sigma_{cantilever} &= \frac{100 \ \mbox{lbf} \ 10 \ \mbox{in}}{\frac{\pi}{32} (1.0 \ \mbox{in})^3} &= 10185 \ psi
\end{align}

Sure, doubling the cantilever rod's diameter gets us an 8-fold decrease in stress, but we're still off by orders of magnitude from the axial case.

Indeed, designing good load paths trumps adding material every time.

\section{Big Sections}
\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:big_sections}
Wide but thin is stronger and stiffer.
\end{theorem}

Recalling the equation for bending stress,

\begin{equation*}
	\sigma = \frac{M y}{I} = \frac{M}{S}
\end{equation*}

and looking at \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_second_moments_of_area}{\color{red}\underline{a number of shapes and their equation for $I$}},

 we notice that the moment of inertia $I$ grows roughly with the cube of the tube diameter. If we think about this and the geometry, that would mean that in a piece of tubing with the same cross-sectional area, we could get a greater $I$ by maximizing the diameter and minimizing the wall thickness. There is a problem with taking this to an extreme (consider the humble aluminum beverage can), but in general, the effect of increasing the diameter of a section dwarfs the effect of increasing the thickness by the same relative amount.

The same is also true of shafts in torsion / carrying torque.

Additionally, notice how multiple moments of inertia are listed for some shapes. Consider a piece of rectangular box tube. It can be bent in two orientations. One has a much larger effective diameter, so is the stronger and stiffer direction. Consider the orientation you lay tube when making structures.

\section{Minimize, Centralize, and Lower Mass}
%TODO: this

\section{Spread the Base}

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:spread_base}
The wider the base, the more stable.
\end{theorem}

Similar to how increasing the diameter of a section increases strength, so does increasing the diameter of bolt patterns, sprockets, gears, and just about anything that transfers load.

Increasing the diameter has another benefit beyond strength, and that is backlash.

%TODO: simple calculation showing how loads are resolved (see the minesota FLL for a simple example)

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{imgs/hub_tolerance.png}
	\caption{Loose-fitting pins (orange) in a hub (blue).}
\end{figure}

Consider the pins in a hub illustrated above. While a bit exaggerated, clearance between components is necessary to ease assembly, and to deal with manufacturing tolerances. These clearances and tolerances are generally fixed with respect to the diameter of the bolt circle, however. We could minimize the angular slop in this assembly by increasing the diameter.

An interesting conclusion of theorems \ref{theorem:load_paths} and \ref{theorem:spread_base} is that using a linear actuator of some sort on a pivoting mechanism can be more precise and strong than one driven by a rotary actuator at its pivot point.

\section{Abbe Error}

\textit{Abbe error}\index{Abbe/sine error}, or \textit{sine error} refers to the error that can come about when parts are not aligned angularly as they were expected to be.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{imgs/abbe_error.png}
	\caption{Abbe error on a micrometer.}
\end{figure}

The error is equal to:

\begin{align}
	error = h \ sin(\theta) \approx h \ \theta \ \mbox{(for small $\theta$)}
\end{align}

Expressed verbally this means that

\begin{theorem} \label{theorem:abbe}
Angularity adds up, proportional to the distance.
\end{theorem}

If precision matters, minimize the angular error of your mechanism, or minimize the lever arm associated with the angular error.


\section{Tolerance Stacking}

Consider stacking multiple blocks that are all $10 \pm 1$ mm thick to achieve a height of $100$ mm. We would need 10 blocks, and so the error would compound among each block, up to $\pm 10$ mm! Clearly, one singular component would be better, even if it had a lower tolerance of even $\pm 5$ mm.

Considering also that more components means more cost, and more potential weak links,

\begin{theorem}
Minimize the number of components.
\end{theorem}

\section{Loosening}

\textit{Positive retention}\index{positive retention} is ensuring that vibrations and loads will not effect the positioning of components. This means avoiding slots for adjustment (that do not have additional locking schemes like cams), and bolts that must be ``just properly tightened" in order to work properly.

We discussed a number of mechanisms for keeping bolts from loosening under vibration in section \ref{subsec:threads}. Most of these solutions don't cost much to implement. There's generally no reason not to do them. And so,

\begin{theorem}
Positive retention is awesome, let's do more of that.
\end{theorem}

\section{Poka-Yoke}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{imgs/poka_yoke.png}
\end{figure}

\textit{Poka-yoke}\index{poka-yoke} is Japanese for ``idiot-proofing". It refers to designing processes that cannot be messed up, or at least not without warning. Think of plugs that cannot be installed backwards, or a shaft that has a special keying on it to ensure proper clocking. Even the brightest of us can be idiots in the moment, so in short,

\begin{theorem}
If someone can screw it up, don't let them.
\end{theorem}	

\textit{Commonizing} the types and sizes of fasteners is also useful for field service and production-line efficiency. Reducing the number of part and tool sizes which a technician must carry can greatly improve productivity, as does reducing the number of different parts which must be purchased, stocked, and inventoried. This is why oftentimes on mass-produced products some fasteners seem grossly oversized- if you look closely, you may see other nearby fasteners which use the same size head, or even the exact same bolt. Even in competitive environments, the technician effort saved by using a larger but common bolt size can make the difference between making the next match and not- making up for the weight increase in spades.
